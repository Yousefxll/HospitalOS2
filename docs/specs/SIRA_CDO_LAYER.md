\f0\fs24 \cf0 \uc0\u55357 \u56594  SYRA \'97 CLINICAL DECISION & OUTCOMES\
\
OFFICIAL INITIAL SYSTEM SPECIFICATION\
\
IMPORTANT \'97 READ FIRST\
\
This is the FIRST and ONLY specification you will receive for this system.\
There are no previous versions.\
Do NOT invent features, workflows, or logic.\
Do NOT assume missing behavior.\
If any requirement is unclear, you MUST ask before building.\
Build exactly as written.\
\
\uc0\u11835 \
\
1. PURPOSE OF THIS LAYER\
\
This layer exists to:\
	1.	Support clinicians with context-aware clinical decision support\
	2.	Detect risk, deviation, and failure early\
	3.	Measure true clinical outcomes, not documentation activity\
	4.	Provide governance-grade evidence for quality and accreditation\
\
This system must NEVER:\
	\'95	Diagnose\
	\'95	Place orders\
	\'95	Replace clinician judgment\
	\'95	Act autonomously\
\
\uc0\u11835 \
\
2. POSITION IN SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE\
\
This layer sits on top of the clinical system and reads data from:\
	\'95	Patient charts\
	\'95	Orders\
	\'95	Medications\
	\'95	Protocols\
	\'95	Vital signs\
	\'95	Laboratory results\
	\'95	Procedures\
	\'95	Endorsements / handovers\
	\'95	Transfers and discharges\
\
This layer is READ + ANALYZE + ALERT ONLY.\
\
\uc0\u11835 \
\
3. CORE PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\
\
A. Decision \uc0\u8800  Action\
	\'95	The system may prompt, warn, or flag\
	\'95	Humans decide, act, and document\
\
\uc0\u11835 \
\
B. Outcomes Over Activity\
\
Track:\
	\'95	What happened to the patient\

Build the SYRA Clinical Decision & Outcomes layer exactly as specified.\
\
Rules:\
- The system is decision-support only and read-only.\
- Analyze clinical data to detect risk, deviation, and outcome patterns.\
- Generate clinician-facing decision prompts and governance dashboards.\
- Do not place orders, diagnoses, or autonomous actions.\
- Do not invent workflows, logic, or features.\
- Ask for clarification before deviating from this specification.\
